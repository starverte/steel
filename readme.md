Core plugin of the Sparks Framework. Works for any theme; but when paired with Flint your WordPress site will be on fire.

## Description

Steel adds certain capabilities through several optional modules. We are continuing to add modules, so stay tuned.

### Bootstrap
Bootstrap 3 is included with Steel, and comes alive through newly added shortcodes!

### Quotes
Display a random quote (or testimonial) in the sidebar with our random quote widget. We are looking at embedding random quotes within a post or page in our next update.

### Slides
Create and display media slideshows using Bootstrap’s Carousel plugin.

### Teams
Create profiles for board of directors, staff members, etc. and display them on a nice summary page.

## Future Modules
* Aliases - Have multiple "pretty permalinks" point to the same post or page, or create a "pretty permalink" for an offsite link.
* Events - Add an events calendar to your WordPress site
* Podcast - Add a podcast with different channels and different feeds, available to listen online or via iTunes
* Styles - This module will replace the need for shortcodes by adding buttons and styles to TinyMCE.

Suggestions for other modules? Let us know via the Support tab.
