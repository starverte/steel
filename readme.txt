Core plugin of the Sparks Framework. Works for any theme; but when paired with Flint your WordPress site will be on fire.

== Description ==

Steel adds certain capabilities through several optional modules. We are continuing to add modules, so stay tuned.

= Bootstrap =
Bootstrap 3 is included with Steel, but currently requires implementation. We hope to include shortcodes and functions for carousels, accordions, and more in our next update.

= Quotes =
Display a random quote (or testimonial) in the sidebar with our random quote widget. We are looking at embedding random quotes within a post or page in our next update.

= Teams =
Create profiles for board of directors, staff members, etc. and display them on a nice summary page.

= Future Modules =
* Aliases - Have multiple "pretty permalinks" point to the same post or page, or create a "pretty permalink" for an offsite link.
* Events - Add an events calendar to your WordPress site
* Podcast - Add a podcast with different channels and different feeds, available to listen online or via iTunes
